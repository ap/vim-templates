This is a Vim plugin for providing filetype-dependent templates for new files, using a simple but effective mechanism.


Usage
-----

When you start a fresh buffer, setting a `filetype` on it will load the corresponding template. E.g. open Vim and issue

    :setf html

You should find a skeleton HTML file, ready to fill in.

One new command has been added for convenience: it is called `:New` and takes exactly one argument. It will open a new empty window and set the filetype for it to the argument given.

A handful of templates are included, but the real purpose of the plugin is to allow you to easily create your own.

Options
-------

The templates are only applied to new files, not existing empty files. If you want to setup templates so that they apply to empty files, add the following line to your `.vimrc`

    g:templates_empty_files = 1


Creating templates
------------------

Templates are kept in `.vim/templates`. The template filename must be equal to the `filetype`. So when you set the filetype of an empty buffer to `html`, `.vim/templates/html` will be loaded. It's that simple.

In the templates, you can use a `cursorline` directive to specify a position for the cursor after loading the template. Such a cursorline works much like a modeline: the word `cursor:` must appear, followed by one or two numbers and opionally the word `del`, all separated by whitespace. The first number specifies the line the cursor will be placed in. The second, if present, specifies a column. The optional word `del` directs the script to remove the cursorline at load time. Take a look at the templates supplied in the package, it should be fairly self-explanatory.
